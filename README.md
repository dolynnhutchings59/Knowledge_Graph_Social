# Knowledge Graph Social Network - A Decentralized Approach to Connection

Knowledge Graph Social Network revolutionizes the way we connect, focusing not on mere friendships but on the deep, meaningful exchanges of knowledge. Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, our platform enables users to maintain their privacy while engaging in rich discussions based on encrypted knowledge graphs.

## The Pain Point: Redefining Social Connections

In today's digital landscape, social networks often prioritize superficial interactions based on friend counts and likes. These platforms can foster shallow communication and lead to a culture of identity over ideas. Users are increasingly aware of privacy issues, particularly concerning the data they share. This creates a demand for a platform that emphasizes thoughtful exchanges while safeguarding user information.

## The FHE Solution: Secure and Meaningful Interactions

Our platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a cutting-edge technology that allows for computations on encrypted data. This capability is made possible using **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. By employing FHE, we can ensure that users' knowledge graphs remain private and secure while still enabling the platform to connect users based on the similarity of their encrypted data. This innovative approach fosters an environment where ideas thrive without compromising personal information.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE-Enriched User Knowledge Graphs:** Users create their knowledge graphs, which are securely encrypted using FHE, allowing only authorized computations on the data.
- **Homomorphic Matching:** Users are matched based on the similarity of their encrypted knowledge graphs, facilitating meaningful interactions.
- **Focus on Ideas, Not Identities:** The platform encourages exchanges of thoughts, rather than merely connecting users through their identities.
- **Resistance to Shallow Interactions:** Designed to encourage deep discussions and learning, the platform actively discourages the superficial culture prevalent in traditional social media.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**
- **Node.js**
- **Hardhat / Foundry**
- **React / Vue.js** (for frontend development)
- **IPFS / OrbitDB** (for decentralized storage)
